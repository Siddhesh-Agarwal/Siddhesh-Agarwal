### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Siddhesh Agarwal** and I am a high school student.
Few things that interest me are:
- Coding (I know only Python)
- Mathematics
- Science (Physics and Chemistry to be specific)

I am currently working on [Python Projects](https://github.com/Siddhesh-Agarwal/Python-Projects) and am looking for people to contribute to it.
